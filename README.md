Explorative Analysis of Physical Health Status of citizens of USA
## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the "Explorative Analysis of Physical Health Status of People in USA" project. This project, authored by Sunitha Hiremath, aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current physical health status of individuals in the United States. With rising concerns over physical inactivity and poor nutrition contributing to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, this project seeks to delve into these issues using recent data and studies.

The analysis covers various aspects including physical activity levels, nutritional habits, and health outcomes, and it identifies key factors contributing to physical health issues. By leveraging data from reliable sources like the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, along with academic publications, the project offers valuable insights into the trends and changes in physical health over time. Additionally, it provides recommendations for improving physical health through better lifestyle choices and effective community-based health initiatives.

We hope this project serves as a useful resource for researchers, policymakers, and health practitioners working towards enhancing the physical health and well-being of people in the USA.
